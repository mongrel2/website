<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Mongrel2 is a web server. HTTP requests come in, HTTP responses go out. Request,
response. There is nothing revolutionary or extravagant in what Mongrel2 does with
a browser, apart from supporting fancy asynchronous socket protocols. To the
browser, Mongrel2 is just this nice web server that has WebSockets and Flash Sockets
in it. That&#8217;s it.
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >What makes Mongrel2 special is how it satisfies these requests in a  <span 
class="pplri7t-">language agnostic</span>
and <span 
class="pplri7t-">asynchronous </span>way using a <span 
class="pplri7t-">simple messaging protocol </span>to talk to <span 
class="pplri7t-">applications</span>; not just
serve files. Mongrel2 is also designed to be incredibly easy to <span 
class="pplri7t-">automatically manage </span>it
as part of your infrastructure.
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Other web servers do some of these things, but they either do them in a bastardized
way or not all of them at once. Plenty of language specific web servers like
Node.js and Jetty have asynchronous operation, but they&#8217;re not language
agnostic<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x3" id="fn1x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x4-4001f1"></a>.
Other web servers will let you talk to any language as a backend, but they insist on
using HTTP proxying or FastCGI, which is <span 
class="pplri7t-">not </span>friendly to asynchronous
operations.
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Mongrel2 is the only web server I know of that actively tries to focus on these
features as a cohesive whole.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x4-50001.1"></a>Language Agnostic</h3>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >The term &#8220;language agnostic&#8221; came from people who read about Mongrel2 in the
early days, and it means that Mongrel2 does <span 
class="pplri7t-">not </span>try to promote any one language
over any others. Mongrel2 does not care if you run a &#8220;Python shop&#8221;, or if you&#8217;re a
die hard PHP fan, or if you hate PHP and love only Ruby on Rails. Mongrel2 only
knows about HTTP requests, HTTP responses, async messages, and getting them to
your gear to meet those requirements.
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >Language Agnosticism is the most important feature of Mongrel2, and its entire
purpose stems from the desire to reduce the amount of programming language
religion in the world. Real people want to get things done, not wanker on which
technology is the best or force other people to use their favorite toys. Instead,
Mongrel2 works to just be great for every language and make it easy to use what
works best for a given problem.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x4-60001.2"></a>Asynchronous</h3>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Many web servers are &#8220;asynchronous&#8221; internally, and some force you to know way
too much about how they work internally to get anything done. What makes
Mongrel2&#8217;s version of asynchronous messaging different is that it extends
to <span 
class="pplri7t-">outside </span>the Mongrel2 server. This is a powerful concept that even your
backends can operate asynchronously using simple identification of connected
clients.
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >Other servers assume that every request is received by a browser, then sent to a
backend, and then directly sent out to the client and that&#8217;s it. Mongrel2 assumes that
there is a connected client, and it sends requests to backends, but it makes no
assumptions about how those backends respond to the clients. All it requires is that
the backend application send messages addressed to the client and it will write them
on the socket.
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >Because of this design, Mongrel2 can easily house both classic HTTP clients,
keep-alive style HTTP clients, chunked encoding responses, JSSockets, or
WebSockets using the same code.
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                  

                                                                  
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3    </span> <a 
 id="x4-70001.3"></a>Message Protocol</h3>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >In order to properly do asynchronous messaging in a language agnostic way,
Mongrel2 needed a good base protocol that allowed for different messaging
styles and worked with many different languages. HTTP proxying already
does this, although it&#8217;s not asynchronous at all. What gives Mongrel2 its
special powers is ZeroMQ, a language- and transport-mechanism-agnostic
messaging system that does <span 
class="pplri7t-">not </span>require a centralized messaging server to
operate.
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >Using ZeroMQ lets Mongrel2 talk to a huge number of languages, operate within
any kind of network architecture, and do it with a very simple communication
model and API that most programmers can understand.
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.4    </span> <a 
 id="x4-80001.4"></a>Application Oriented</h3>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >Web servers today are written as if it was still 1995 and all anyone needs to do is
serve files, maybe some graphics. Today&#8217;s web applications are not about serving
files; they&#8217;re about serving application logic <span 
class="pplri7t-">and </span>doing it asynchronously. The advent
of the bewildering numbers of ways to hack HTTP into an async messaging
protocol<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x3" id="fn3x3-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x4-8001f3"></a>
is proof enough that the pressure is on for web servers to be for applications with
highly interactive interfaces.
<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >Mongrel2 can still serve files just fine. In fact, it&#8217;s got very accurate and
easy-to-understand file serving code. However, Mongrel2 will always be about
applications. Fast, scalable, awesome, asynchronous or synchronous applications
that need to use languages that mere mortals can work with, like PHP. If there&#8217;s ever
a choice, apps win.
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.5    </span> <a 
 id="x4-90001.5"></a>Automated Management</h3>
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >The language agnostic philosophy even extends to the configuration system, where
you can use any language you need to configure it and manage it, as long as
the results are a SQLite3 database Mongrel2 can read and work with to
run. There are great tools for managing this database already written in
Python and C, but if you hate Python or C then you can write anything you
want.
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >This pattern is established with servers like Postfix, Exim, Sendmail, qmail, and
                                                                  

                                                                  
others, that convert configuration files to half-assed SQL databases. Mongrel2
effectively adopts a Model-View-Controller design for its configuration
system, the same way every web application is designed today. The Model
is a SQLite3 database file, which any programming language can access.
The Controller is a Mongrel2 process that reads this file and sets itself up
accordingly.
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >The View is a C binary (with no dependencies other than SQLite3 and ZeroMQ)
called m2sh that gives you a command line &#8220;UI&#8221; to configure and setup the
Mongrel2 sqlite model. It gives you commands for managing it, crafting
configurations, looking at them; the works.
<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >But, most importantly, <span 
class="pplri7t-">you can write your own</span>. You don&#8217;t have to wait for a Mongrel2
developer to craft a configuration file parser for your favorite language, or use some
hack job Nagios Perl junk to automate or scan it. It&#8217;s SQLite3 with a solid, simple
schema and even a well written Python and/or C code example showing you how it
works.
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >Nothing stops you from automating the hell out of Mongrel2 with that.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.6    </span> <a 
 id="x4-100001.6"></a>Using This Manual</h3>
<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >This manual is intended to be fun to read, so probably the best way to use it is to
actually <span 
class="pplri7t-">read it</span>.
<!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >I know, revolutionary, right? I mean, who has time to read and learn about
something these days? You just want to get in there and get whatever problem you
have done, now! No time for words. You just want a straight dump right into your
brain so that you are able to solve all your problems instantly and screw all this
talking.
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >Did you ever ask yourself if this attitude about not wanting to read and learn is
possibly the reason you always get stuck in emergencies with no time to read and
learn?
<!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >Something to think about.
<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >My recommendation is that you go through every page of this manual and do the
stuff in it. Even if you think you won&#8217;t need something, because you&#8217;re
not a programmer, or you&#8217;re not in operations, you should learn it. Doing
so will make the parts you do need clearer and give you better ideas for
later.
